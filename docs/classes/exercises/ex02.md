# Class 02 exercises

## 1. Data structures

1. Create a dataframe of 3 columns and 4 rows filled with any data you like.
2. Name each column of the dataframe.
3. Name each row of the dataframe.

*Note*: This is not described in the class slides. You will have to search the web for a solution. Use the terms you find in the questions to look for an answer.


## 2. Diatoms data

Consider the table you have exported in the previous class.

1. Load it into R as a `Data Frame`.
2. Get the "Species richness" value for the "CC1" sampling station.
3. Obtain a vector with the "Diversity H'" values for all sampling stations.
4. Obtain a vector with values from all variables for the "DC1" station.
5. Get all variables from only the "Snake River" stations. *Hint*: Remember you can select rows (or columns) based on conditions.


## 3. Online data

Consider the following online file: [Link 1 (gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/StuntsPT/bp2020/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/poke_data.csv), or [Link 2 (github)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StuntsPT/BP2020/master/docs/classes/exercises/poke_data.csv).

1. Load the data into R directly using the URL.
2. Explore the data in the file using R. What is this about?
3. What is the minimum `HP` a monster can have? And the maximum? (Bonus: which monsters are these?)
4. For each kind of `Type 1` how many monsters are there? What if we restrict the data to Generation 1? *Hint*: Read about the "table()" function 
5. Which monster of `Water` type has the highest `Sp. Attack` value? *Note*: This is a tough one. Good luck!

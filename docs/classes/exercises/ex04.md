# Class 04 exercises

In this practical class you will hone your plotting skills in R.

## Blood pressure

Consider the [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) website. In there you will find many sets of data.
In this exercise we will be obtaining data for blood pressure per country, for both [men](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArfEDsV3bBwCdHNwRm9DN1FnT3hXWWZVSncxMkZyS2c&output=csv) and [women](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArfEDsV3bBwCdHBzUVVSMDlTX1ZCUnNJQ3ZFdkFXVFE&output=csv).
Each of the requested plots has to be saved to a `.png` file. Don't forget to look at the data, especially the headers (Check out the `sub()` function to "sanitize" them). Also, make sure to use colours to make your point.

1. Plot blood pressure values per year for Portuguese women from 1985 to 2005. *Hint*: Use `as.numeric()` to convert a data frame row to a vector.

2. Make a new plot, where you can compare blood pressure values between Portuguese men and women between 1980 and 2008.

3. Make a new plot where you can easily compare blood pressure between Portuguese and Spanish populations (both male and female) between 1980 and 2008.

4. Draw bar plots where you can compare Canadian, Finnish, Chinese and Greek blood pressure values for the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. Make a plot for men and one for women, and save them side by side. 

## Pokedata Pt.2

Get the [Pokemon data](https://gitlab.com/StuntsPT/bp2020/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/poke_data.csv) again ([Alternate link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StuntsPT/BP2020/master/docs/classes/exercises/poke_data.csv)).

1. Plot histograms that show the distribution of HP, Sp. Defense and Speed values.

2. Draw a scatter plot of Sp. Defense vs. Defense and another of Sp. Attack vs. Attack 

3. Draw a boxplot where you can compare the `Sp. Attack` values between `fire`, `water`, `electric`, `ice` and `grass` Pokemon. Colour them accordingly.

4. Make 3 more similar plots for `Sp. Defense`, `Speed` and `HP`. Display all 4 plot in a `2x2` grid.
